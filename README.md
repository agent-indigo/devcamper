# DevCamper API

## Description

This is the DevCamper API project from Brad Traversy's 2020 Node.js API Masterclass with Express and MongoDB course on O'Reilly.

I made the following modifications:

- Converted the entire project from CJS to ESM

- Installed packages for a React frontend, but haven't built it yet

- Other minor modifications.
